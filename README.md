# Python-Util-UET
Short, useful, educational Python Unix Epoch Time utility.

This is what I'm calling a codelette.  It's a little bit of code that does something, but has some value beyond that for learners like me.  (I don't know about you, but I'm always learning.  Always.)

"et.py" stands for EpochTime.py, and is a commandline utility that will do one of two things immediately:
 - it will give you a UET value if you don't provide any commandline arguments
 - it will show you the local and GMT human-readable time for any UET value you provide on the commandline

There is nothing awe-inspiring about this codelette, but there is a lot that can be learned from it.
